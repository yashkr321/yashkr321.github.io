    <p>
        currently pursuing my btech degree at assam down town university, guwahati. 
        <a href="#">join</a> us!
    </p>

    <p>
        my journey in tech started early, and over the years, now, iâ€™m focused on something exciting â€” a project thatâ€™s shaping the future of ai in ways that will change the game. while i canâ€™t reveal all the details yet, i can promise you, something big is coming. stay tuned!
    </p>

    <p>
        this website is a WIP. iâ€™ve shifted my focus to build the project, but i plan to write more soon to capture a trend of changes in my thinking, but until then, my e-mail is the best place to catch thoughts.

    <h2>
     inspired by
    <a href="https://nat.org">nat</a>
    , some things i believe:</h2>

    <div class="quote">
        "make mistakes of ambition and not mistakes of sloth." â€” machiavelli. i would rather constantly bite more than i can chew, than settle for mediocrity and never know the extent of my capabilities.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>speed is intelligence.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>as a young person, your rate of progress is the best vector to measure growth and potential. while a lot of things in life can be thought of as chess, early on, you're almost always better off thinking of it as a race. inaction is just missed shots.</li>
            <li>a lot has been said over the years about speed in the context of startups, but every week, i re-assess our speed internally. the faster you ship, the faster you learn, the faster you refine direction.</li>
            <li>every acceleration eventually becomes a constant. recalibrate regularly.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>startups</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>a lot has changed about software in the "post-gpt" era. over the past few years, saas/software has become a predictable and indexed business category.</li>
            <li>i think we're going back to the time when venture returns are skewed only to risky, outlier and long term bets.</li>
            <li>if you're a young technical team, you're better off focusing on building extraordinary product/tech advantage than picking distribution battles. creating software has never been easier, and thus, non-technical people with distribution are no longer at a disadvantage in most markets. the "tech" arbitrage opportunity is vanishing.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>people</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>be kind, be direct and transparent. life is short.</li>
            <li>don't be a gatekeeper, you lose out on compounding.</li>
            <li>moments are fleeting, people endure.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>what motivates me?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>as we get closer to a <a href="#">post-scarcity world</a>, we're all closing in on the fundamental question of metaphysics (why is there something rather than nothing?)</li>
            <li>for some, the answer is hidden in space. for others, it's in studying history. as of now, my answer is hidden somewhere in accelerating our understanding of cognition and intelligence. someday, a super intelligent system can help us see through the chaos that clouds our understanding of the physical universe. all my work is a derivative of this broader pursuit. (i also don't have enough money to mine asteroids yet)</li>
            <li>i like working with exceptional people who challenge and expand my worldviews. building a startup is by far the best way to do this quickly.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <script>
        // Check for saved theme preference or default to light
        const savedTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme') || 'light';
        document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', savedTheme);

        function toggleTheme() {
            const currentTheme = document.documentElement.getAttribute('data-theme');
            const newTheme = currentTheme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light';
            
            document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', newTheme);
            localStorage.setItem('theme', newTheme);
        }
    </script>

        i will probably add more to this list soon â€” meanwhile feel free to say hi on
